It's about URDF model
	The model of six servo arms sizing is scaled up by 5 times to make use of the interactive maker properly. So, any operation or simulation in the different situations will require scaling relatively.
	You can edit the scaling of the model by changing the scale in the URDF file in six_servo/urdf folder. But keep that in mind, you must change every property in terms of origin xyz in the URDF file as same as your new scaling and it is meant to change every single link and joint.
